## Development Guidelines
- Use Python 3.11 and type hints for all new code.
- Format code with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and lint with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).
- Keep imports sorted using `ruff --select I --fix` or a similar tool.
- Run tests with `pytest` and make sure they pass before committing.

## Pull Request Expectations
- Provide a brief summary of your changes and how they were tested.
- Include any relevant documentation updates when behavior changes.
